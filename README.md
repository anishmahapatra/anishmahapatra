# Hey THere! 🌟 I'm Anish Mahapatra

Hailing from the tech hub of Bangalore, India, I stand at the intersection of data and creativity as a Senior AI & Data Scientist at 7-Eleven. By day, I translate numbers into narratives; by night, I spin tales of tech and code. With a trove of experience—6.5 years and counting—I'm on a mission: to demystify data science & AI and spread knowledge like wildfire.
