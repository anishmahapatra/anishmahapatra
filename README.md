# Hey There! 🌟 I'm Anish Mahapatra

Hailing from the tech hub of Bangalore, India, I'm a Senior AI & Data Scientist at 7-Eleven. By day, I translate numbers into narratives; by night, I explore the realms of tech and code. With over 6.5 years of experience, my mission is simple: make data science & AI clear and accessible, while sharing the knowledge I've gathered along the way.
